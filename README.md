This project is apart of my Weekly Project Challenge. Big thanks to [slin349]("https://github.com/slin349") for working on this project with me.

# Weekly Project Challenge
I've challenged myself to build something every week. My motivation for doing this challenge is to a) explore crazy ideas that I might otherwise put off b) explore different technologies that I don't normally use c) better understand my learning pace and d) give myself something to do while I'm at home all day.

Along the way, I plan to collaborate with friends as it just makes everything a bit funner :)

I might continue to work on some of these projects after the week but I'll tag the last commit included in the timeline of the challenge with wpc (weekly project challenge).

# Project #1 - Weiv
Weiv is a web application that enables people to watch Youtube videos together. 

Users can create a room or join through a link. Each room has its own chat, video player, and queue. Weiv supports synched play and pause control, as well as timeline seek. Users can add Youtube videos to the queue by copy and pasting the url into the form. 

## TODO's if I had more time
- Add ability to change current video
- Reorder and remove items from the queue
- Displaying the video data (photo, title, uploaded by, etc) would be nice
- UI for mobile
- (BUG) Joining an already existing room does not fetch the video queue of the room until the queue is updated
- Host it so that people can use it
